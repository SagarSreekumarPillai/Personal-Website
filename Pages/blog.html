              <p class="card-text mt-3">In tech, designers and developers often work in separate silos. But as a Unicorn Designer with both design and development skills, I find these worlds can harmonize. Here’s how my experience as a developer improves my design work.

                Designing with Feasibility in Mind
                Understanding front-end tech (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) helps me create designs that are not just aesthetically pleasing but also practical. I reduce the need for revisions by designing solutions that are easier for developers to implement.
                
                Smoother Collaboration
                I can act as a bridge between design and development, understanding both aesthetic goals and technical constraints. This reduces friction during implementation and ensures a smoother project workflow.
                
                Faster Prototyping
                My ability to code means I can quickly create functional prototypes. This allows for faster feedback, better testing, and more informed design decisions.
                
                Being both a designer and a developer helps me solve problems efficiently, producing designs that not only look great but also work seamlessly.</p>

              <h5 class="card-title">Designing for Performance: Why UX Designers Should Care About Code Efficiency</h5>
              <p class="card-text mt-3">User experience is more than just good design—performance plays a huge role. Here’s why UX designers should care about code efficiency.

                Slow Design is Bad Design
                No matter how well-designed a product is, if it’s slow, users will abandon it. Performance issues like slow load times can ruin a good user experience.
                
                Understanding Code Helps Optimize Performance
                Knowing how to code lets me spot and fix performance bottlenecks early. I design components that are efficient to implement, minimizing heavy elements like complex animations.
                
                Design and Code Evolve Together
                In an iterative development process, complex designs can slow things down. I ensure that my designs are not only visually appealing but also lightweight, speeding up development and improving performance.
                
                By focusing on performance and efficiency in design, you can ensure that users enjoy a seamless, fast experience with your product.</p>

              <h5 class="card-title">The Power of Prototyping: Why UX Designers Should Code Their Own Prototypes</h5>
              <p class="card-text mt-3">Prototyping is a critical part of the UX design process, but taking it a step further by coding your own prototypes can be a game changer. Here’s why:

                Improved Communication with Developers
                When you code your prototypes, you speak the same language as developers. This reduces ambiguity and ensures your vision is implemented more accurately. It’s easier for developers to understand how your design should behave when you provide a functional example.
                
                Realistic Testing and Feedback
                Interactive, coded prototypes provide a much more accurate representation of the final product. This means you can test functionality, performance, and usability in real-world conditions, gathering better feedback from users and stakeholders.
                
                Faster Iterations
                When you can code, you can quickly make changes to your prototype based on feedback. This speeds up the design process and allows for more rapid iterations, ultimately leading to a more polished final product.
                
                Coding your own prototypes not only improves collaboration with developers but also leads to more efficient and realistic design iterations.</p>
